Curves from different cross-validation or bootstrapping runs can be averaged by different methods, and standard deviations, standard errors or box plots can be used to visualize the variability across the runs. The parameterization can be visualized by printing cutoff values at the corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the curve according to cutoff. All components of a performance plot can be quickly adjusted using a flexible parameter dispatching mechanism. Despite its flexibility, ROCR is easy to use, with only three commands and reasonable default values for all optional parameters.",0.8365092168647381

An alternative way to search over the parameter space of trees is to use global optimization methods like evolutionary algorithms. The 'evtree' package implements an evolutionary algorithm for learning globally optimal classification and regression trees in R. CPU and memory-intensive tasks are fully computed in C++ while the 'partykit' package is leveraged to represent the resulting trees in R, providing unified infrastructure for summaries, visualizations, and predictions.",0.9928908175291002
