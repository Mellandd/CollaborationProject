Curves from different cross-validation or bootstrapping runs can be averaged by different methods, and standard deviations, standard errors or box plots can be used to visualize the variability across the runs. The parameterization can be visualized by printing cutoff values at the corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the curve according to cutoff. All components of a performance plot can be quickly adjusted using a flexible parameter dispatching mechanism.

What is the LiblineaR package?,"A wrapper around the LIBLINEAR C/C++ library for machine learning (available at <https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/>). LIBLINEAR is a simple library for solving large-scale regularized linear classification and regression.
